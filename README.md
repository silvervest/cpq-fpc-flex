# Compaq FPC floppy flex ribbon replacement

This is a recreation of the stock Compaq FPC floppy flex ribbon used in Compaq LTE Elite (and possibly other) laptops, with Citizen W1D (and possibly other) floppy drives.

Stock part no. is 194635-001 and the Compaq spare part no. is 149588-001

## Manufacturing

I am yet to prototype this completely, but I will be ordering from JLCPCB with their Flex PCB manufacturing process with the following settings:
* Layers: 1
* PCB Thickness: 0.11
* Stiffener: Polyimide
* Polyimide Thickness: 0.15mm

Once I've got a fab'd item in hand, I'll update this README with photos and such.
